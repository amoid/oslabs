听录音，然后回答以下问题。
Was the vicar pleased that the clock was striking? Why?

    Our vicar is always raising money for one cause or another, but he has never managed to get enough money to have the church clock repaired. The big clock which used to strike the hours day and night was damaged many years ago and has been silent ever since.
    One night, however, our vicar work up with a start: the clock was striking the hours! Looking at his watch, he saw that it was one o'clock, but the bell struck thirteen times before it stopped. Armed with a torch, the vicar went up into the clock tower to see what was going on. In the torchlight, he caught sight of a figure whom he immediately recognized as Bill Wilkins, our local grocer.
    'Whatever are you doing up here Bill?' asked the vicar in surprise. 
    'I'm trying to repair the bell,' answered Bill. 'I've been coming up here night after night for weeks now. You see, I was hoping to give you a surprise.'
    'You certainly did give me a surprise!' said the vicar. 'You've probably woken up everyone in the village as well. Still, I'm glad the bell is working again.'
    That's the trouble, vicar,' answered Bill. 'It's working all right, but I'm afraid that at one o'clock it will strike thirteen times and there's nothing I can do about it."
    We'll get used to that, Bill,' said the vicar. "Thirteen is not as good as one, but it's better than nothing. Now let's go downstairs and have a cup of tea.'

我们的牧师经常的筹钱因为这理由或那个理由，但它始终没有设法筹到足够的钱去修复教堂大钟。这个曾经每天报时的大钟在许多年前被损坏了，现在已经沉寂多时了。
然而有一天的晚上，我们的牧师终于开始工作了：因为这口大钟开始报时了！看看他自己的表已经一点了，但是钟敲了十三下。牧师拿着火把进入钟楼去看有什么事情发生。在火把灯光的照耀下，他看到了一个人，他立即认出来了是比尔维根斯，我们本地的杂货铺老板。
你在这里做过些什么，牧师惊讶的问道。
我在试着修钟，比尔回答到，我已经数周在晚上到这里来了。你瞧，我想给你个惊喜。
你确实让我吃了一惊！牧师说道。你可能已经吵醒了村子里的每个人的好梦了 。可是，我还是很高兴这钟又重新工作了。
那是个意外，牧师。比尔回答到。它整晚的工作，可是我担心在一点的时候它又要敲十三次并且我也不能再为它做什么。
我们会处理这个问题的，比尔，牧师说到。敲十三下虽然不如敲一下好，但是总比不敲强，走我们到楼下来杯茶。

    我们教区的牧师总是为各种各样的事筹集资金。但始终未能筹足资金把教堂的钟修好。教堂的钟很大，以前不分昼夜打点报时，但很多年前遭到毁坏，从此便无声无息了。
    一天夜里，我们的牧师突然被惊醒了，大钟又在“打点”报时了！他一看表，才1点钟，可是那钟一边敲了13下才停。牧师拿着一支电筒走上钟楼想去看看究竟发生了什么事情。借着电筒光。他看见一个人，马上认出那是本地杂货店主经比尔.威尔金斯。
    “你究竟在这上面干什么，比尔？”牧师惊讶地问。
    “我想把这口钟修好，”比尔回答说。“好几个星期了，我天天夜里到钟楼上来。嗯，我是想让你大吃一惊。”
    “你确实使我大吃了一惊！”牧师说，“也许同时你把村里所有的人都吵醒了。不过，钟又能报时了，我还是很高兴的。”
    “问题就在这里，牧师，”比尔回答说。“不错，钟能报时了，但是，恐怕每到1点钟，它总要敲13下，对此我已无能为力了。”
    “大家慢慢就习惯了，比尔，”牧师说。“13下是不如1下好，但总比1下也不敲强。来，咱们下楼去喝杯茶吧。”
